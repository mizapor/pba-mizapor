## Before Doing Assignment

If you have not done the [task00](../task00), do it first to set up the C++ graphics development environment.

Follow [this document](../doc/submit.md) to submit the assignment, In a nutshell, before doing the assignment,

- install `eigen` library following  [this document](../doc/setup_eigen.md)
- make sure you synchronized the `main ` branch of your local repository  to that of remote repository.
- make sure you created branch `task08` from `main` branch.
- make sure you are currently in the `task08` branch (use `git branch -a` command).

Now you are ready to go!

## Problem 1

Then, run the code. Take a screenshot image. 
Save the screenshot image overwriting `task08/problem1.png`

## Problem 2

This code means to inflate the bunny's mesh twice the volume while minimizing the elastic potential energy of the mass-spring system.
 
Write a few lines of code around `line #83` and `line #147` to set constraint to the volume using the Lagrangian multiplier method. Do not write complicated or long code.

Write down the elastic potential energy of spring shown in the standard output after the convergence below: 

***elastic potential energy == 0.298599***

## After Doing the Assignment

After modifying the code, push the code and submit a pull request.


## Notes

- Do not submit multiple pull requests. Only the first pull request is graded
- Do not close the pull request by yourself. The instructor will close the pull request
- If you mistakenly merge the pull request, it's OK, but be careful not to merge next time.
